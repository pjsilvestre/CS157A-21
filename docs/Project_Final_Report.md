## Requirements

### Project Description in Detail

#### Goal

The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly application capable of
providing users with a convenient way to collect, organize and share various
articles of clothing in an ever growing market of apparel. Users are presented
with collection and sorting functionality in their closets via a GUI.

#### Motivation

This project was inspired by an absence in similar applications among the
industry. Music, TV, and literature are all examples of domains with limitless
streaming, collection and sharing capabilities. The fashion industry is a
comparably large source of income expenditure among multiple demographics
with very limited technical representation. This application seeks to bring
similar functionality of other social media or streaming services by allowing
users to collect (and eventually share) their favorite clothing items and brands
in an easy manner.

#### Stakeholders

- Students / Young Adults; Women; Professionals

  - This demographic has the desire to maintain a fashionable appearance.

  - In addition, they often have physical closets and often look for ways reduce
    time spent on outfit planning.

- Project Team

  - The team is concerned with creating and maintaining the app as necessary.

#### Application Domain

This application is based in the fashion and clothing domain.

#### User Benefits

- Clear Clothing Organization

  - Users will be able to come up with outfit ideas more conveniently as they
    can clearly view their entire closet.

  - Users will no longer need to go through the steps of pulling out a piece of
    clothing from a physical closet, trying to pair it with another piece, and
    putting it back if not satisfied with the pairing. Instead, users can create
    outfits via their virtual closet.

- Reduced Spending on Clothing

  - Users will be able to avoid buying clothing similar to the ones they already
    own. The application provides an easy and organized view of the user's
    entire
    clothing collection.

### Functional Requirements in Detail

#### Account Creation and Login

- New users can register for accounts.

- New accounts are persisted in the database.

- Returning users can log in to their accounts provided correct credentials.

#### Adding Attire

- Users can add a piece of attire to their closet

- Users can enter text descriptions of the attire, such as type,
  brand, color, and size.

- The application stores this piece of attire and all relevant information
  in the database.

#### Viewing Attire

- Users can view the attire in their closet in a list format. Additionally,
  users can sort attire in their closet based on certain attributes (e.g brand).

#### Updating Attire

- Users can edit the information for existing attire in their closet.

- The application persists this edited information in the database.

#### Removing Attire

- Users can remove existing attire from their closet.

- The application successfully deletes the selected piece from the database..

#### Adding Outfits

- Users can organize attire into outfits, primarily based on an outfit name.

#### Viewing Outfits

- Similar to viewing attire, users can also view their outfits in their closet.

#### Removing Outfits

- Users can remove outfits from their closet.

#### Adding Worn Entries

#### Viewing Worn Entries

- Users can view a history of outfits they wore over time.

#### Removing Worn Entries

- Users can remove worn entries.

#### Adding Friends

- Users can add other users to their friendlist. This functionality is more akin
  to "following" in other social networks, rather than actual "friending".

#### Viewing Friends

- Users can view their friendlist, and their friends' outfits.

#### Removing Friends

- Users can remove friends.

### Non-Functional Issues in Detail

#### Graphical User Interface

The team strove to create an aesthetic graphical user interface that aims to
exhibit the best qualities of user interface design, from clarity to
consistency. The front end was built in HTML via the Pug templating engine, and
heavily utilized the CSS library Bootstrap.

- Account Creation and Login

  - Upon opening the app, the user can navigate to an account creation page or
    login page.

    - The account creation form prompts the user to input a username and
      password.

    - The login form is similar to the account creation form.

  - After successful login, the user is presented with the home page with their
    name and a navigation bar to navigate the app.

- Viewing the Closet

  - The user can freely browse their closets, with pieces represented via text.

- Adding, Updating, and Removing Attire

  - The navigation bar features options for adding, updating, and removing
    attire.

  - When the user chooses to add a new piece, the app presents an
    easy-to-use form, allowing for user input.

  - When updating pieces, the app presents current information on a piece.

#### Security

We aim to ensure that a given user can see only their closet, and that a given
closet can only be seen by its respective user. This is implemented through
user authentication and sessions.

## Design

### Entity / Relationship Diagram

![ER Diagram](./images/database_design_3.0.png)

### Entity Set Descriptions

#### user

User is an entity set with two attributes: a unique username and password. The
key of user is username. The user entity set represents users of the application
and their login information.

#### closet

Closet is an entity set corresponding to a users's physical closet. The key of
a closet is closet_id. The closet entity set consists of a collection of
clothing the users save as outfits (multiple clothing pieces) or as attire
(individual clothing pieces).

#### outfit

The outfit entity set has three attributes: a unique name, a season, and a
tag. The key of an outfit is outfit_name. The outfit entity set consists of
"mini-collections" of clothing pieces that the users save as outfits. The tag
allows a user to organize different outfits into groups.

#### attire

The attire entity set has six attributes: attire_id, type, name, brand, color,
and size. The key of a piece of attire is attire_id. The attire entity set
consists of all the individual clothing pieces the users save.

### Relationship Descriptions

#### closet `owned_by` user

Many closets are owned by one user (many-one from closet to user).

#### `outfit_contained_by_closet`

Many outfits are contained by one closet (many-one from outfits to closet).

#### `attire_contained_by_closet`

Many pieces of attire are contained by one closet (many-one from attire to
closet).

#### outfit `is_composed_of` attire

Many outfits are composed of many pieces of attire (many-many from outfit to

## Implementation

### Overview

whatdoiwear.today is a Node.js & Express application which focuses on CRUD
functionality via SQL queries. The team focused on comprehensive create, read,
update, and delete functionality for the app's most prominent entity set:
attire. Afterwards, the team added create, read, and delete functionality for
the app's other entity sets, such as outfits and friends.

### Installation

#### Downloading the App

Run the following using your shell:

```sh
git git@github.com:pjsilvestre/CS157A-21.git
cd CS157A-21/express-app
```

#### Setting up MySQL

Make sure you have [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed, and start your
server using your shell:

```sh
sudo mysql.server start
```

If your MySQL root password is not `password`, you can change it as follows
using your shell, then MySQL:

```sh
$ mysql -u root -h localhost -p
Enter your password: ****************
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Alternatively, navigate to `express-app/config/database.js`, and change
authentication details as necessary.

#### Populating the Database

Run the following using MySQL, replacing `<...>` with the directory containing
`CS157A-21`:

```sh
mysql> source <...>/CS157A-21/sql/initialize-schema-and-data.sql
```

Alternatively, use a tool like
[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to run the script.

#### Running the App

Make sure you have [Node.js](nodejs.org) installed, then run the following using
your shell, making sure you're in the `CS157A-21/express-app` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

The app should now be running on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000). For
experimentation purposes, use any of the predefined accounts, all of which have
the password `password`.

### CRUD Functionality - Attire

For brevity, we will detail CRUD functionality as it
pertains to the most prominent entity set of the app: attire.

#### Read

Functionality related to reading attire can be found in `closet.js`.

To view their attire, a user can navigate to their closet.

![read-01](./images/implementation-final-report/read-01.png)

Upon navigating to their closet, a user is presented with their attire in
tabular form.

![read-02](./images/implementation-final-report/read-02.png)

We first obtained a user's closets.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM closet
  JOIN owned_by USING (closet_id)
WHERE username = '${req.user.username}';
```

We then obtained the attire in the user's default closet:

```sql
SELECT
  type, attire_name, brand, color, size
FROM
  user
    JOIN
  owned_by USING (username)
    JOIN
  attire_contained_by_closet USING (closet_id)
    JOIN
  attire USING (attire_id)
WHERE
  username = '${req.user.username}' AND
  closet_id = '${closets[0].closet_id}';
```

#### Create

Functionality related to adding attire can be found in `add-attire.js`.

To add attire, a user can navigate to add-attire.

![create-01](./images/implementation-final-report/create-01.png)

The add-attire page features a form where a user inputs details related to a
piece of a attire.

![create-02](./images/implementation-final-report/create-02.png)

The user can then add a piece's details.

![create-03](./images/implementation-final-report/create-03.png)

After the user submits the form, they are redirected to their closet.

![create-04](./images/implementation-final-report/create-04.png)

We first obtained a user's closets:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  closet
    JOIN
  owned_by USING (closet_id)
WHERE
  username = '${username}';
```

We then added the piece to `attire` and `attire_contained_by_closet`:

```sql
INSERT INTO attire VALUES (
  '${attire_id}',
  '${type}',
  '${attire_name}',
  '${brand}',
  '${color}',
  '${size}');

INSERT INTO attire_contained_by_closet VALUES (
  '${attire_id}',
  '${closet_id}');
```

#### Update

Functionality related to editing attire can be found in `edit-attire.js`.

To edit attire, a user can navigate to edit-attire.

![update-01](./images/implementation-final-report/update-01.png)

A user can choose a piece to edit.

![update-02](./images/implementation-final-report/update-02.png)

A user can then edit a piece's information, such as its size.

![update-03](./images/implementation-final-report/update-03.png)

After the user submits the form, they are redirected to their closet.

![update-04](./images/implementation-final-report/update-04.png)

We first obtained all of the attire associated with the user:

```sql
SELECT
    attire_id, type, attire_name, brand, color, size
FROM
  user
    JOIN
  owned_by USING (username)
    JOIN
  attire_contained_by_closet USING (closet_id)
    JOIN
  attire USING (attire_id)
WHERE
  username = '${req.user.username}';
```

We then updated the piece in `attire`:

```sql
UPDATE
  attire
SET
  type='${newType}',
  attire_name='${newAttireName}',
  brand='${newBrand}',
  color='${newColor}',
  size='${newSize}'
WHERE
  attire_id=${attireID};
```

#### Delete

Functionality related to deleting attire can be found in `remove-attire.js`

To remove attire,, a user can navigate to remove-attire.

![delete-01](./images/implementation-final-report/delete-01.png)

A user can chose a piece to delete.

![delete-02](./images/implementation-final-report/delete-02.png)

After the user submits the form, they are redirected to their closet.

![delete-03](./images/implementation-final-report/delete-03.png)

We first obtained a user's closets:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  closet_id, location
FROM
  closet
    JOIN
  owned_by USING (closet_id)
    JOIN
  attire_contained_by_closet USING (closet_id)
WHERE username = '${username}';`;
```

After a closet has been selected, we obtain the attire associated with that
closet:

```sql
SELECT
  attire_id, attire_name, closet_id
FROM
  user
    JOIN
  owned_by USING (username)
    JOIN
  attire_contained_by_closet USING (closet_id)
    JOIN
  attire USING (attire_id)
WHERE
  username = '${username}';
```

We then delete the piece from `attire`, `attire_contained_by_closet`, and
`is_composed_of`. The schema for `is_composed_of` is (outfit_name,
attire_id),
where both are keys. Although we want to delete all entries matching our
chosen attire_id, MySQL rejects this, as it wants a `WHERE` clause with both
an outfit_name and attire_id. To simplify this, we can turn off safe
update mode before the query, and turn it back on after the query. Not sure if
kosher, but the alternative involves a more complex query.

```sql
DELETE FROM attire
WHERE attire_id = '${attire_id}';

DELETE FROM attire_contained_by_closet
WHERE attire_id = '${attire_id}';

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
DELETE FROM is_composed_of
WHERE attire_id ='${attire_id}';
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1;`;
```

If all of the pieces associated with an outfit are removed, logically,
the outfit ceases to exist. For an outfit, if there's no corresponding
entry in `is_composed_of`, we remove the outfit from `outfit`,
`outfit_contained_by_closet`, `is_composed_of`, and `worn_by`. We start by
getting all outfits associated with a user:

```sql
SELECT
  outfit_name
FROM
  owned_by
    JOIN
  outfit_contained_by_closet USING (closet_id)
WHERE
  username = '${username}';
```

We can then check to see if there is still at least one piece of attire
in the outfit by checking that we get at least one result from the following
query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  outfit_Name
FROM
  is_composed_of
WHERE
  outfit_name = '${outfit_name}';
```

If the previous query returns no results, we delete the outfit:

```sql
DELETE FROM outfit
WHERE
  outfit_name = '${outfit_name}';

DELETE FROM outfit_contained_by_closet
WHERE
  outfit_name = '${outfit_name}';

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
DELETE FROM worn_by
WHERE
  outfit_name = '${outfit_name}';
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1;
```

## Conclusion

### Team Retrospective

#### Devin Gonzales

This project served as a challenging introduction into full-stack development
with the inclusion of both front-end and back-end components. Developing in
JavaScript utilizing Node.js and Express has taught me a lot about server-side
design and the difficulties that come with not only ensuring complete
functionality of a web application but also designing an effective UI for a
client. I learned first-hand the role of a database in the back-end of an
application as well as how databases interact with the server to bring
functionality to an application. My experience with this project has also
given me an acute disdain for Node's package manager and the challenges
that come with debugging npm. Despite these challenges, this project has
provided an opportunity for me and my team to grow as programmers and gain
experience developing applications.

#### Claire Lin

Through this project, I learned programming languages such as HTML, Node.JS,
mySQL, and frameworks for full-stack web development. I also gained a
valueable lesson in teamwork. I learned that constant communicate with the
team is especially important when everyone has a busy schedule and that the
programming langauges we were using were new to us. I was not very active in
comminicating because I always felt that I had to make progress before I could
update my teammates. If I ever got stuck, I would keep working and not update
my teammates about my problems. I, later, realized that not constatnly
updating my team about my progress can resulted in my team confused about my
progress and worried if the project can be completed by deadlines. Now, I try
to update my team on any problems I faced or progress made. Besides, I learned
that having respect towards each others' work is essential to maintaining good
work spirit. I felt that I am not as proficient in the HTML and Node.JS as my
teamates are even though I spent a lot of time learning them. But, whenever I
made a commit, my teammates would affirm my work, which encourages and
motivates me to keep working on the project.

#### Patrick Silvestre

whatdoiwear.today was an interesting exercise in full-stack web development.
I had limited experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via a CMPE 131
project. This class's project was considerably more complex, and I had to
learn a order of magnitude more about server-side website programming. I
learned several lessons for the future, such as, "start implementation early",
"schema changes are expensive", and "technical debt will need to be repaid".

### Future Improvements

Fashion is primarily visual in nature. As such, allowing users to upload
pictures as they add attire to their closet is the next logical step for
whatdoiwear.today. A potential, yet lofty, goal is to create a central datastore
of attire so users do not need to enter details about attire that could be
instead scraped from the internet, such as the brand or color of a certain piece
of attire.
